                <p class="abt-p">I'm Zoe a multidisciplinary creative, art director, and designer. I moved from the United States to Malaysia when I was little, instilling a love for travel and any and all food. Since then, I have continued to explore the world and don't plan on stopping any time soon. I enjoy spending my days searching for thrift finds to add to my wardrobe and waiting for multiple Adobe programs to load at the same time. I want to make this world bright and full of art one ad at a time!</p>
