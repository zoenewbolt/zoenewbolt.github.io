        <h1> Zoe Newbolt</h1>

        <h2>Background</h2>
             <p> Welcome to my web page! This page explores everything you need to know about me, Zoe Newbolt, as both a person and music lover. I am a traveler, having moved four times so far. I was born in Georgia, <abbr title="United States">U.S.</abbr> and then when I was ten I moved to Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia for six years. I loved my time there and it definitely gave me the travel bug. I returned back to the states at 16 years old and moved to Connecticut. When it was time for college I decided I was read to go somewhere warm again, missing Malaysia, and so I made the decision to move down to Miami and attend the University of Miami! I have loved every second of it and as a senior in college it is bitter sweet deciding where I will move to next. </p>
             <p>Besides my experience traveling and my love for it, my other passion is music. Specifically, I am a big fan of <abbr title="Electronic Dance Music">EDM</abbr> and House music. I love to go to music festivals to listen to my favourite DJ (Claptone) live. Additionally, I enjoy listening to this type of music when I go on my runs. My favourite place to run while listening to EDM in Miami is by the shore in Coconut Grove. It is a beautiful spot, especially at sunrise and I will miss it when I leave Miami.</p>

        <h2>My Favourite Musical Artists</h2>
             <p> Now lets dive into the most important stuff, my favorite musical Artists! I know I said that House music and DJ's are my favourite style of music but I also enjoy Country and more relaxed music like Indie. This list will reflect my favourite artists in order and let you know alittle bit more about what kind of person I am. I believe that the quickest way to learn about a person is to pull up their Spotify and take a look at their playlists so here's a look into my music world.</p>

        <h2>Where I Have Lived</h2>
            <p>In the introduction I dove into how I have lived in quite a few places, but I decided to five deeper with this table below. I have organized where I have lived and a little bit about what each place was like.</p>
